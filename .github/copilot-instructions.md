# Processor Design Tool - Copilot Instructions

This is a visual processor design tool that allows users to create CPU architectures using drag-and-drop components.

## Project Features
- **Baustein-Bibliothek**: Component palette with ALU, Register, Memory, Control Unit
- **Drag & Drop Canvas**: Visual editor for connecting components with bus systems
- **Session-based Storage**: Non-persistent design storage using sessionStorage
- **Optional Simulation**: Command execution simulation (ADD, LOAD, STORE)
- **Export Functionality**: Generate overview graphics or JSON dumps

## Development Guidelines
- Use modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)
- Implement drag-and-drop with HTML5 Drag API or modern libraries
- Use Canvas or SVG for visual component representation
- Session-based storage only (no database persistence)
- Clean, modular code architecture
