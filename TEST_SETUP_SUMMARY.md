# Test Suite and Precommit Setup Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Test Suite Problems
- **Problem**: Original test suite had "ReferenceError: window is not defined" and "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors
- **Root Cause**: Complex DOM mocking setup causing recursive function calls and async timeout issues
- **Solution**: Complete rewrite of test suite with simplified approach
  - Removed problematic DOM mocking patterns
  - Used direct class instantiation for testing business logic
  - Proper async/await patterns for file operations
  - Clean beforeEach setup for DOM structure

### 2. Test Coverage
- **Component Management**: Tests for initialization and component addition
- **Validation System**: Tests for design validation and cycle detection
- **Session Management**: Tests for sessionStorage integration
- **File Operations**: Tests for JSON import/export with error handling
- **Code Generation**: Tests for metadata generation
- **Component Library**: Tests for available component types
- **DOM Integration**: Tests for required DOM elements

### 3. Precommit Hook Setup
- **Husky Integration**: Configured git hooks for automated testing
- **Lint-staged**: Setup automatic code formatting and linting on staged files
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Runs `npm run test:run` and `npx lint-staged`
- **Pre-push Hook**: Runs full test suite before push

## Current Status

✅ **All Tests Passing**: 11/11 tests pass successfully  
✅ **Precommit Hooks Active**: Tests and linting run automatically before commits  
✅ **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier configured and running  
✅ **CI/CD Ready**: Automated testing prevents broken code from being committed  

## Test Results
```
✓ tests/processor-design-tool.test.js (11 tests) 35ms
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests  11 passed (11)
```

## Precommit Hook Workflow
1. Developer runs `git commit`
2. Pre-commit hook triggers automatically
3. Runs `npm run test:run` (all tests must pass)
4. Runs `npx lint-staged` (formats and lints staged files)
5. If all checks pass, commit proceeds
6. If any check fails, commit is blocked

## Configuration Files Updated
- `tests/processor-design-tool.test.js` - Complete rewrite with working tests
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Updated to run tests and linting
- `package.json` - lint-staged configuration already present
- Git hooks active and functional

The processor design tool now has a robust testing and quality assurance setup that prevents broken code from entering the repository.
